<br />

### [Personal web site and literary experiment in continuous research, authoring, curation and archiving that is instantly published digitally and always print-ready.]{.smallcaps} ###

<br />
_A continually-compiled and edited "Complete Works" that is always approaching
the goal of final definitive compendium but will never reach it until I can't
type anymore._

_An attempt to bridge pre-and post-internet traditions of authoring and distributing
creative and intellectual work._
