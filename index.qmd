An experiment in simultaneous research, authoring, and digital/print publishing.

**EDIWTB** is:

*"Edit/Distribution Integration from Web Template to Books"*

or

*"Every Day I Write The Book"*

That is, as a matter of producing a lifetime's creative output, instead of going
through separate stages of doodling, inspiration, research, drafting, editing
and then posting or printing of individual works or publishable volumes, I
envision incorporating every day's work into a provisional final form that is
always ready for publication on the web and in print, and asymptotically
approaches but never reaches the final definitive compendium of complete works
that represents a life's effort.

Thus bridging pre-and post-internet traditions of creating and distributing
creative and intellectual work.
