*Goodbye to Berlin* reads as a tenuously connected series of character sketches 
and anecdotes, collected by the author during his years in the city at the end 
of the Weimar era, teaching English to support himself as he tried to write. 
The novel famously set off the chain of inspirations (another set of tenuous 
links) that led eventually to the play and movie *Cabaret*.

Isherwood's tone generally ranges from bemused detachment to mild disdain, and 
sometimes to outright alienation, as the first page contains the well-known 
passage: "I am a camera with its shutter open, quite passive, recording, not 
thinking."

But as he is poised at his window, depicting himself as a passive observer, in 
the very next paragraph he relates how young men come down his street in the 
autumn evenings and boldly whistle up to their lovers in their own flats on the 
block. He is not passive in his observation of these rude, passionate, messy 
pursuits of the necessities of life; rather, his reaction is one of active 
repulsion: "Because of the whistling, I do not care to stay here in the 
evenings... I determine not to listen to it, pick up a book, try to read."

On the first page he thus reveals himself as a liar. He is actively on the run 
from life. Is he being ironic, or is he unaware of his duplicity, 
un-self-reflective? It is from the point of this self-revelation, knowing or 
otherwise, that the work unfolds as a novel not a sketchbook, with a direction 
and a conclusion meaningful to Isherwood the narrator.

He describes his room as a microcosm of the dead Berlin of the past:

> The tall tiled stove, gorgeously coloured, like an altar.  The washstand like 
  a Gothic shrine.  The cupboard is also Gothic, with carved cathedral windows: 
  Bismarck faces the King of Prussia in stained glass.  My best chair would do 
  for a bishopâ€™s throne.  In the corner three sham medieval halberds (from a 
  theatrical touring company?) are fastened together to form a hatstand.
 
Isherwood the narrator is hiding in Berlin, among the shadows that the past 
still casts there. For him it is a labyrinth where he can avoid himself. The 
connecting thread of the novel is how the city progressively turns into a hall 
of mirrors, where he must at last catch glimpses of himself, but only through 
the prisms of other people -- without seeming to realize it.

While nightcrawling with the wild English teen runaway Sally Bowles, he meets 
Clive, a rich American who is happy to pick up the bills as the three lose 
themselves in weeks of partying. Clive is typically American to English eyes, 
voluble and outgoing, always ready for a good time. "Yet, even as he appealed 
to us, I thought I could sometimes detect odd sly flashes of sarcasm.  What did 
he really think of us?"

Isherwood seems oblivious to the notion that, in his condescending and 
supercilious manner with others, always masked by his charming English 
politeness and diffidence, he might come across to others in the same 
way. When Clive suddenly disappears from town, there is a glimmer of reflection: 
"I imagined him leaving every new town and every new set of acquaintances in 
much the same sort of way. I sympathized with him, a good deal."

He encounters a shuffling senior drug addict in a dive bar: "The old man had a 
nervous tic and kept shaking his head all the time, as if saying to Life: No.
No. No." By this time it is not hard for the reader to fill in for oneself just 
who it is saying No.

Isherwood decides to spend the following summer on a working-class resort 
island, as always claiming that the move is to facilitate his writing. He 
shares a cabin with another Englishman, Peter, who is close to him in age, and 
with a German teenager named Otto. In this sketch, the narrator soon seems 
strangely to disappear almost entirely from the narrative, and the focus falls 
on Peter as he seems forlornly to pursue a relationship with Otto, without any 
hint given as to the goal of his pursuit (beyond the priapic association of his 
name).

Peter, in his lugubrious, hang-dog pursuit seems uncannily to be a golemic 
projection of Isherwood himself, evidently lacking self-consciousness or 
capacity for introspection; he seems to want to play house with Otto, but the 
teen is too energetic and volatile for that.  Peter's desire not only dares not 
speak its name, but he cowers even from conceiving what he wants.

And so Isherwood's aloofness progresses via metaphor to a crippled inability 
to cultivate an inner life, a deficiency that comes to threaten his life 
spiritually and physically as the Nazi party begins its final ascent to power.

In Berlin he makes friends with Bernhard, a cultured department store manager 
from a wealthy family. Bernhard's life has all the trappings of success and 
happiness, but he is dissatisfied in ways he will not express, and is evidently 
paralyzed when it comes to making changes.  Like Isherwood he hides behind a 
mask, one of culture and taste. Bernhard seems to be courting Isherwood in 
enigmatic fashion, but like Peter is unwilling or unable to put a name to his 
desire.

Finally Isherwood lashes out:

> I often wonder why you have anything to do with me at all.  I feel sometimes 
  that you actually dislike me, and that you say and do things to show it... 
  what I can't stand is that you show your resentment by adopting this 
  mock-humble attitude.... Actually, you're the least humble person I've ever 
  met.

Again, Isherwood shows no self-consciousness that this is how he likely comes 
off to others. Their relationship ends with Bernhard saying:

> all this seems to me a little unreal, a little -- please don't be 
  offended, Christopher -- trivial, I know that I am getting out of touch with 
  existence... Do you know, there are times when I sit here alone in the 
  evenings, amongst these books and stone figures, and there comes to me such a 
  strange sensation of unreality, as if this were my whole life? Yes, actually, 
  sometimes, I have felt a doubt as to whether our firm -- that great building 
  packed from floor to roof with all our accumulation of property -- really 
  exists at all, except in my imagination... And then I have had an 
  unpleasant feeling, such as one has in a dream, that I myself do not exist.
 
And with this self-incrimination Bernhard indicts himself, Christopher and 
Berlin all at once.  Unwillingness to face oneself, denial of one's inner life, 
leads to loss of empathy, loss of touch with reality, and paralysis; and 
through this spiritual void the Nazis are able to march to power.

In his soulless wanderings through the labyrinth of the city, Christopher 
encounters not only the rich and dissipated but also the poor, sick and debased. 
 His encounters begin at last to awaken in him the sense that others are real, 
and with that comes the beginnings of empathy and a balanced sense of what life 
is.

He at last takes on Herr N. as a pupil, a middle-class government employee who 
is planning to emigrate to the United States:

> Herr N. talks to me chiefly about his family. He is worried about his son, 
  who is very delicate... His wife is delicate, too.  He hopes the journey 
  won't tire her.  He describes her symptoms, and the kind of medicine she is 
  taking... In a tactful, impersonal way we have become quite intimate... 
  Behind everything he says I am aware of an immense sadness.

Herr N. is grappling with the necessities of life no less than the profane 
whistlers under Christopher's window. Love, care and sadness, taken together 
over the years, compose a life. And rather than feeling repulsion from life's 
messiness, for the first time in the novel Christopher describes himself as 
feeling actual intimacy with someone.

And now at last Christopher is able to sense the reality of the Nazi threat, as 
something more than a joke being played on the citizens of Berlin who unlike 
him don't have the option to leave. He is shocked to overhear a conversation 
between a young Nazi and his girlfriend in a cafe:

> "Oh, I know we shall win, all right," he exclaims impatiently, "but that's 
  not enough!" He thumps the table with his fist: "Blood must flow!"
 
The stakes to him now are real. Like Herr N. he at last finds the will to break 
his paralysis and leave Berlin in pursuit of an authentic life.  On the eve of 
leaving, he visits a cabaret with his friend Fritz. As they leave they 
encounter a party of rowdy young Americans:


|    "Say," he asked Fritz, "what's on here?"
|    "Men dressed as women," Fritz grinned.
|    The little American simply couldn't believe it... "Do you mean they're 
     *queer*?"
|    "Eventually we're all queer," drawled Fritz solemnly, in lugubrious 
     tones...
|    "You *queer*, too, hey?" demanded the little American, turning suddenly on 
     me.
|    "Yes," I said, "very queer indeed."

 
On the first page of the novel Isherwood describes himself as a camera, a 
mechanism, recording only the surface features of life without 
evident capacity for introspection.  On the last page he is able to 
imagine photographic reality in its proper proportion, as something distinct 
from him and his personal identity and feelings, which are as real to him now 
as what the camera shows:

> I catch sight of my face in the mirror of a shop, and am shocked[^2] to see 
  that I am smiling... The trams are going up and down the Kleiststrasse, just 
  as usual. They, and the people on the pavement, and the teacosy dome of the 
  Nollendorfplatz station have an air of curious familiarity, of striking 
  resemblance to something one remembers as normal and pleasant in the past -- 
  like a very good photograph.

[^2]: I made a strange and somewhat disturbing discovery when checking this 
quote at an online source. The word "shocked" is replaced by "horrified" in all 
editions I could find but one: The New Directions Publishing edition of 1963, a 
reprint of which I have owned for many years. This edition is "my" *Goodbye to 
Berlin*, and now I find it is in its own way unique, a mutant, a *lusus 
naturae*. The Internet Archive let me check editions from 1954 to the present, 
and all the others contain the latter word. It's disturbing because in a tale of 
rising fascism it seems Orwellian to change a text, even though to no evident 
purpose. Also disturbing because substituting this single word changes the tenor 
of the ending, and thus of the entire novel. One can be positively or 
negatively "shocked," thus the word here suggests that Isherwood may be 
pleasantly surprised by the changes that have been wrought in him. But 
"horrified" only goes one way. The word suggests a much darker and more confused 
psyche in the narrator as the text ends. I can't fathom why such a change would 
have been made. Regrettably I don't have the energy or eyesight to check 
exhaustively in what other ways this edition may differ from the others.
