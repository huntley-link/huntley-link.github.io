# Some Prefer Nettles

*Some Prefer Nettles* is a dry, arch domestic comedy with a hidden dark 
dimension, about an affluent married couple who have determined that their 
marriage is over, but can't bring themselves to take the final step of seeking 
a divorce – each waiting on the other to make the decisive break. And so they 
carry on in a years-long exquisite expectant misery. Extended stasis is hardly 
something that a narrative can be crafted from, and the novel indeed upends any 
notions of a western-style progression of conflict, climax and resolution. But 
the work is so full of meticulously crafted observational ironies, that it is 
carried forward on the momentum of successive revelatory insights, carefully 
hidden from direct view but nevertheless breaking through the confusion of piled 
up puzzles and contradictions. It presents an alternative concept of the novel 
form, resembling the making of a color woodblock print: as each color ink is 
patiently applied to paper by a separate block, the total composition of the 
work eventually resolves itself.

The story takes place in and around Osaka, over the course of a spring season 
in the late 1920s, as the couple Kaname and Misako are drawn into her father's 
retirement enthusiasm for classical Japanese puppet theater. This lead-off 
level of irony is easy to spot; as the couple endure the awkward social demands 
of attending performances together with her father (and waited on by the old 
man's mistress O-hisa), it is clear that they are driven by the external 
imperatives of social convention, while the tragic romantic plots of the puppet 
plays invite comparison to the couple's own situation.

On top of this, Kaname observes that his father-in-law has put great effort 
into training and shaping O-hisa, in her early twenties, to fit the role of the 
ideal hostess of the antique classical Japanese culture, just as it is being 
replaced by the country's rapid Westernization ( "She's one of the antiques in 
his collection, exactly like an old doll," Kaname remarks to Misako). There's 
no mistaking the identification of people with puppets and dolls. But…

Kaname slowly reveals his dark side in the way he is becoming consumed by his 
sensual obsessions. At first this side of him is presented in amusing fashion, 
as he fantasizes being free of his wife and reliving the pleasures of his youth 
with fresher women. Before long his cousin delivers to him an expensive Western 
volume he has requested from a specialty bookseller, an edition of *1001 
Arabian Nights* with lavish erotic illustrations which he flips through 
languorously but with intent notice of the charms of women of another race. 
Later, free from Misako for a day, he visits his favorite prostitute Louise in 
a brothel that specializes in offering white women. But Louise has some Asian 
blood and worries that her complexion is too dark, so she covers herself in 
white cosmetic powder to lighten herself. Kaname finds that after their 
rendezvous much of the powder has adhered to him.

This calls back to an earlier erudite discussion of the fine points of puppet 
artistry, which includes the comment, "The Osaka craftsmen, in their efforts to 
produce the effect of the human skin, leave a coating of powder over the 
paint." Kaname is first figuratively, then literally identified with a puppet 
or doll, captured in transition to something refined but monstrous. After 
encountering Louise, the scent of her powder "seemed to sink deep into his 
skin, it permeated his clothes, it even spread through the taxi when he left 
and overwhelmed the room when he got home." 

Thus all Kaname's comparisons of O-hisa to a doll directed by his father-in-law 
become twisted up in irony. He himself is transforming into something of an 
automaton, driven only by yearnings, lusts and social expectations, but with no 
inner life. It is a depiction of a modernist form of the ancient Buddhist 
concept of *samsara*.

O-hisa, by contrast, gradually embodies a striking form of liberation. Although 
by no means free in the role put upon her as servant/mistress, she acquires an 
archetypal power as she comes to embody the meeting of the present and past, 
rather than simply cosplaying it as her master intends.

Again, this is depicted at first in subtle, wry fashion. Although not 
particularly attractive herself, her name is shared by a well-known classic 
beauty of the eighteenth century, who was depicted many times in the woodblock 
prints of her era. Early on, Kaname remarks on her unappealing dentition: "her 
two front teeth were as black at the roots as if they had been stained in the 
old court manner...." But as he himself notes, stained black teeth were fine 
ladies' court fashion for centuries in classical Japan. In her present poverty 
and lack of dental hygiene, she effortlessly echoes the most refined details of 
the former era.

Kaname notices that she and his father-in-law have unexpectedly achieved a 
degree of intimacy, they have a free and easy discourse, he asks her advice and 
follows her instructions. He deeply envies this aspect of their association 
which is lacking in his own marriage.

Much later, Kaname visits a remote rural town said to be the birthplace of the 
puppet theater, accompanying his father-in-law and O-hisa, and the sight of her 
there drives him into a sort of reverie:

>Kaname felt a deep repose come over him. "These old houses are so dark you 
have no idea what's inside."

>Kaname thought of the faces of the ancients in the dusk behind their shop 
curtains. Here on this street people with faces like theater dolls must have 
passed lives like stage lives. The world of the plays -- of O-yumi, Jurobei of 
Awa, the pilgrim O-tsuru, and the rest -- must have been just such a town as 
this. And wasn't O-hisa a part of it? Fifty years ago, a hundred years ago, a 
woman like her, dressed in the same kimono, was perhaps going down this same 
street in the spring sun, lunch in hand, on her way to the theater beyond the 
river. Or perhaps, behind one of these latticed fronts, she was playing "Snow" 
on her koto. O-hisa was a shade left behind by another age.

This collapse of space and time, of reality and metaphor, represents something 
of a last chance for Kaname, a *koan* of incommensurates, an opportunity for a 
modern analog of enlightenment, a recognition of the futility of putting his 
energy into the pursuits of sensual pleasures, which comes at the cost of 
failing to develop a spiritual identity, a *psyche*.

In *The Taming of the Shrew*, Kate says to her father who is trying to to foist 
her on eligible men in marriage, "I pray you, sir, is it your will to make a 
stale of me amongst these mates?"; a stale being a prop, an effigy, a lure. On 
some level she understands that the chief threat that marriage presents to her 
is not being shackled to a man, but to convention; to be a static part of the 
background behind active players, to give up her inner life and identity.

O-hisa faces a similar challenge and has made headway against it. After Kaname 
says goodbye to her and his father-in-law after their rural theater excursion, 
he sees them depart for a tour of Buddhist temples and tries to comfort himself 
again by imagining her as a doll whose only purpose is to please her master. 
But his unbidden reveries betray him:

 >The pious Buddhist aphorism written in large characters on the sections of 
O-hisa's sun-shade (part of her pilgrim's equipment) gradually faded away: "For 
the benighted the illusions of the world. For the enlightened the knowledge 
that all is vanity. In the beginning there was no east and west. Where then is 
there a north and south?" It seemed to him, as he watched them there on the 
dock with their sunshades in the growing distance, that between the two of them 
there was indeed "no east and west" in spite of the thirty years' difference in 
their ages

O-hisa exhibits an uncanny form of power.  Her role suggests the aesthetic 
concept of *wabi*, the flaw or contradiction in the work that indicates its 
limitations and points the way out of abstraction into the frame of reality. 
Although not free, she retains her humanity, her identity, her capacity for 
discourse, and a modernist ability to make the old new. Like Kate in 
*Shrew*, for the moment her horizons are unbounded despite the paradoxes of 
her situation -- suggesting a new age equivalent to *nirvana*.

The threads of irony come together at the end of the novel in disturbing, 
though still oblique, fashion. Kaname and Misako have at last let her 
father-in-law know of the possibility of their divorce, and the old man has 
invited them to his traditional Japanese home to talk it out, eventually taking 
Misako out to dinner to try to talk sense to her one-on-one. Kaname is left 
behind to be tended by O-hisa. At this point his last chance for spiritual 
self-awareness has passed, and he is at the mercy of events. O-hisa offers him a 
bath in their dark traditional bathroom, which he takes in their uncomfortable 
traditional tub, sitting glumly in fetid water, unchanged for days according to 
tradition. In contrast to O-hisa, he is cloistered in by the materiality of the 
old.

She ushers him to his room to stay the night. He again tries to comfort himself 
by objectifying O-hisa in his mind. Sitting alone in the dark room, he suddenly 
thinks he sees O-hisa in the corner – but it is just an antique puppet the old 
man has bought as a souvenir.

The previous layerings of irony suggest that Kaname is however mistaken in who 
he mistook the puppet for. The puppet is now fully a reflection of him. The 
novel suddenly ends when O-hisa enters the room with reading material and 
redirects Kaname's attention away from the puppet to her. No suggestion is 
given as to what is to happen next. But…

The reader is fortunate that Tanizaki's wicked wit provides keys to how to 
approach his ironies. Earlier in the text, while Kaname is still in the phase 
of bemused observation of his father-in-law's enthusiasms, the old man asks 
Kaname's opinion of an ancient folk song they have just heard:

\medskip
<i>

|      "Did you understand the words, Kaname?..."
|      "I have the feeling that I understand vaguely, but I'd probably come up 
|    with something wild if I tried to go at it grammatically."
|      "Quite true... . The composers didn't think about grammar. If you see 
|    generally what was in their hearts, that's really enough. The vagueness is 
|    rich in its own way...  that first part is about a man who visits a woman 
|    secretly at night. Instead of anything direct we have the moon stealing in 
|    through the window. And isn't it better really to leave things only
|    hinted at?"

</i>
\medskip

The title itself is a sort of key. It is derived from a Japanese proverb 
corresponding roughly to the English "one man's poison is another man's meat." 
But upon what meat precisely do Kaname and Miyako feed? The experiences of the 
novel are not a pleasure for them, not a fulfillment of alternative 
preferences; they are not iconoclasts or rebels. They are not nourished, they 
are miserable.

An ironic reflection is required to complete the meaning of the title. The 
ironic reading is closer to another proverb in English: "As a dog returns to 
his own vomit, so a fool repeats his folly." Some gorge on poison, knowing what 
it is they do. *Samsara*.

After the layerings of Kaname's cruelty and lust that have been depicted over 
the course of the novel, his next move is easy to project, and thus the circle 
of dehumanizing obsessions is closed by irony in its purest form, that of total 
darkness. Kaname will try to seduce O-hisa away from his father-in-law, or to 
share her with him; and by stepping on this path he will enter Hell.
