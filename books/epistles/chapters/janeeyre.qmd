# Jane Eyre

#### Charlotte Brontë {.unlisted}

>I know no medium; I never in my life have known any medium in my dealings 
with positive hard characters, antagonistic to my own, between absolute 
submission and determined revolt. I have always faithfully observed the one, up 
to the very moment of bursting, sometimes with volcanic vehemence, into the 
other…


This statement by Jane Eyre, made late in the novel, is one of her few moments 
of self-critical self-insight, and is I think a key to understanding the story 
laid out in the work.

It is a novel of gothic horror, but it was Brontë’s genius to situate that 
horror not in an exotic or supernatural milieu, but in the commonplace setting 
that millions of her readers shared as the reality of their everyday lives. The 
essence of the gothic genre is the sense of being beset by relentless, 
implacable, pitiless forces of doom.[^term] The cliches of the genre up to this 
point had required the likes of monsters, insane stalkers or tyrannical 
overlords. Here, the forces of doom are of the most horrifying kind: the 
ordinary but inescapable social, institutional and psychological pressures of 
the day.

The novel incorporates many themes and raises many issues; of class, gender, 
race, society vs. the individual, etc., that remain relevant and are endlessly, 
perhaps worthily, worked over in discussion of it. But a collection of themes 
and issues does not constitute a story. Not even the plot itself necessarily 
makes up the story.

The story of *Jane Eyre* is:

\itshape

Young Jane finds herself in the milieu of a gothic 
horror story, which is nothing more or less than the everyday life of a young, 
poor orphan of her time. She is beset by monsters and tormentors, and though she 
is exceptional enough to be aware of her plight, she is helpless within it. 
After her first move to a dark and foreboding location, she finds people who can 
express kindness toward her, but they are no less helpless than she is in the 
grip of their institution. She finds herself literally in the embrace of death. 
She moves to the home of a shapeshifting trickster in the form of a Gytrash, and 
a Vampyre. The former becomes a man, and in her discourse with him she finds for 
the first time she is able to find some freedom of action unconstrained by 
gothic forces, to have an actual give-and-take with someone, and this begins to 
humanize both of them. When their bubble bursts and she is denied this 
discourse, she - most horrifyingly - transforms into the monster of the story. 
She becomes pitiless and implacable, ruins lives, and dashes toward death. 
Instead of dying she crosses a threshold of some sort into a nameless place and 
is identified as a spectre. Her revivification begins when she gets to know her 
double reflecting her former life, a self-involved, love-denying pilgrim who is 
crucifying himself. Once she recognizes herself in him, and him in herself, 
time and space collapse and she is able to re-cross the threshold back into a 
human life, finding the aforementioned medium in which she has control of 
herself, and is able to love and to discourse with the world itself. Her love 
and discourse fix the shapeshifter into a deformed but permanent human state; 
and in his own return to the human world, his vision recovers; not entirely, 
but sufficiently that he is always in the condition of seeing the light at the 
end of the tunnel.

In the context above which I have tried to define, *Jane Eyre* is not only a 
gothic horror story, but perhaps the culminatory novel of the genre - it 
recasts the genre from a freak show into something set within the full context 
of human experience, and comes across as a classic in the sense Raymond 
Chandler meant: "a piece of writing which exhausts the possibilities of its 
form and can hardly be surpassed."[^chand]

The question of why she falls in love with her employer Rochster is answered by 
Jane herself: she is first attracted to him because she feels he is the first 
person in her life she is able to have an effect on, who responds to her and 
allows her to respond to him:


>I never seemed in his way; he did not take fits of chilling hauteur: when he 
met me unexpectedly the encounter seemed welcome; he had always a word and 
sometimes a smile for me; when summoned by formal invitation to his presence, I 
was honored by a cordiality of reception that made me feel I really possessed 
the power to amuse him, and that these evening conferences were sought as much 
for his pleasure as for my benefit.


In the mirror reflection of Rochester that Jane holds up to the reader, one 
sees by degrees that he has lived the very same kind of life as her; beset and 
boxed in by forces that he can’t control or even contend with, even though the 
two have virtually nothing in common in their biographies or backgrounds. Yet 
he sees in her what she does in him, someone who responds, who reciprocates, 
who affects and is affected:


>when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing eye to your 
interlocutor's face; there was penetration and power in each glance you gave; 
when plied by close questions, you found ready and round answers. Very soon you 
seemed to get used to me - I believe you felt the existence of sympathy 
between you and your grim and cross master, Jane; for it was astonishing to see 
how quickly a certain pleasant ease tranquillized your manner… I was at once 
content and stimulated with what I saw… 


This is of course in contrast to her experience with the Reed family, and even 
at her boarding school: her best friend Helen, although kind and animated by 
Christian grace was passive and imperturbable, the very image of someone 
immured by gothic forces. She did not struggle against her impending death or 
question her fate at God’s hand despite Jane’s urgings and anxious attendings. 
The contrasting quality and depth of Jane’s interactions with Rochester proved 
transformative.

But when she finds out at her wedding altar that he is already married, she is 
not sufficiently transformed to break her pattern of lashing out at the forces 
she still feels oppress her. Tragically she is overwhelmed by her instinctive 
response and becomes what she has beheld, she is implacable and pitiless in her 
rejection of Rochester’s earnest plea to share a simple life with him outside 
any institutional bounds. Like her friend Helen, she uses her inflexible 
Christian principles to shut herself off from a discourse of love, and imposes 
a horrifying fate on Rochester. In short, she becomes a gothic monster.

Jane leaves and stalks across the heath like a Gytrash dog herself, like 
Rochester when she first met him, and like him she gradually becomes human 
again, in the uncanny interzone where she finds she has a family. And it is the 
relationship established with her cousin St. John that catalyzes the completion 
of her transformation.

Jane notes how distant and taciturn St. John is in company, often disappearing 
behind a book or withdrawing to his study. It doesn’t seem to occur to her 
consciously that this might be how she came across to others in her earlier 
life. She notes with dismay that he is pushing away his love Rosamund and 
passing up the opportunity to spend his life with her out of unwillingness to 
compromise his Christian principles. She never explicitly registers that she 
did the exact same thing with respect to Rochester. And when St. John proposes 
to her, and she counters with an offer to accompany him to India as a partner, 
to pursue a missionary passion outside the socially-expected institutional 
fetters of marriage, Jane does not perceive that Rochester made quite the same 
kind of offer to her.  She turned him down flat, just as St. John refused her 
offer, and for the same reasons: Christian principle and social convention.

Though blind on the conscious level to the parallels between them, St. John 
works on her on a deeper level and she finds herself empathizing with him. She 
senses


>a depth where lay turbid dregs of disappointment - where moved troubling 
impulses of insatiate yearnings and disquieting aspirations. I was sure St. 
John 
Rivers - pure-lived, conscientious, zealous as he was — had not yet found that 
peace of God which passeth all understanding; he had no more found it, I 
thought, than had I; with my concealed and racking regrets for my broken idol 
and lost elysium - regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring; but 
which possessed me and tyrannized over me ruthlessly. 


To encounter one’s opposite number, and to recognize oneself in the other and 
the other in oneself, is the beginning of *psyche*; that is, development of a 
sense of identity not socially given, but internally generated, strong enough to 
resist the buffets of terrifying external forces and act out of one’s own 
passion and will. When Jane gives as good as she gets from St. John, and she 
neither submits nor revolts as previously, she shows that she has found her 
medium, reached a new equilibrium. Upon leaving him finally she says: "It was my 
turn to assume ascendency. My powers were in play, and in force."

*Psyche* is the formerly absent necessary prerequisite for real love. To attain 
it Jane had to go on her journey through the looking glass, and encounter her 
shadow, which at last clarified her to herself. From there she resolves to claim 
her love and seeks out Rochester without any thought to what social or 
institutional framework her love might be realized in. She is out of the matrix 
of the forces of horror that formerly oppressed her. It is simply her good 
fortune that Rochester is now free to marry, a literary trick in a literary 
milieu.

To portray in *Jane Eyre* the power and danger of gothic horror as it arises in 
the everyday, with such fluency in the language and images of the genre, was a 
great imaginative accomplishment. To go beyond that and endorse passionate 
discourse between fugitive allies and antagonists as the counter-strategy to 
terror and despair is to make the case for literature itself. And in that sense 
the novel completes the gothic genre’s cycle of development, and redeems it.



[^term]:  As in the classic expression of gothic terror from our own time, *The 
Terminator*: "It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't 
feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop... ever, until 
you are dead!"

[^chand]: from the introduction to *The Simple Art of Murder* (1950, anthology)
