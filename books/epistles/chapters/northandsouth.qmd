# North And South

#### Elizabeth Gaskell {.unlisted}

*Book Club August 20, 2023*

---

Elizabeth Gaskell was a contemporary of Charles Dickens, and *North and South* 
was published in serial form simultaneously in the same periodical as Dickens’ 
*Hard Times*. But unlike Dickens she lived and worked in Manchester with her 
Unitarian minister husband, and was a direct witness of the social, political 
and economic conflicts and outrages wrought by the industrial revolution, at 
Ground Zero in the era when it was working the greatest and most divisive 
transformations in British life.

To the author’s credit, the novel is not a polemic, and she does not clearly 
throw the weight of her sympathy to any of the main characters. Rather, she 
constructs an intricate labyrinth for the leading man and lady, and forces them 
to thread their way through it to each other; along the way requiring each to 
face their deficiencies and blind spots. The resolution of the story hinges on 
each confronting the self-imposed circumscription of their horizons. Thus 
despite the epochal conflicts surrounding the protagonists, the work brings down 
its scope in the end to necessary human and intimate dimensions.

And that is perhaps the biggest surprise of the experience of reading it, given 
the broad tapestry Gaskell’s discursive and armillary style weaves, as one at 
last perceives in the final pages the intricate trap she has set and sprung on 
both her lovers and the reader.

Reviewers have remarked on Jane Austen’s influence on Gaskell here. Teenage 
Margaret Hale and mill owner John Thornton superficially resemble Elizabeth 
Bennet and Mr Darcy from *Pride and Prejudice*. They meet, he falls in love, she 
dislikes him and dismisses his advances. And Margaret’s parents seem to be 
living a disappointing aftermath of *Sense and Sensibility*. Mrs Hale is 
well-bred and was raised in London society, but marries poor Mr Hale for love 
and resolves to live with him in a remote rural vicarage. As her middle-aged 
regrets mount, Mr Hale supplies the final straw by abruptly announcing that he 
has resigned his position as an Anglican minister for recondite reasons of 
spiritual conscience.

Facing imminent poverty, they move from the south of England to Manchester, the 
center of British industrialization, so Mr Hale can scratch together a living as 
a tutor of the classics to its roughly-educated citizens. Margaret, still a 
dedicated Christian clergyman’s daughter, is appalled at the depredations that 
mill work with its low wages and pollution has wrought on the city’s helpless 
poor. Thornton is an early portrait of a spirited libertarian, always ready with 
passionate justifications and rationalizations for his business practices 
despite the damage they may do.

What appears to be a soap opera-ish discursion is introduced: Margaret’s 
long-absent older brother Frederick returns to visit their mother at her 
deathbed. Frederick had been a naval officer with good prospects, but mutinied 
against a tyrannical captain.  He has been on the run for years, not daring to 
set foot in England for fear of court martial and hanging. He slips into 
Manchester just in time to comfort his mother, but as he departs he is 
recognized and almost captured after a scuffle.

Meanwhile, Thornton is dealing with an impending strike at his mill, but refuses 
to raise his workers’ wages due to what he claims are the iron laws of economics 
and the demands of the market. Mortal bad blood arises between him and his 
union-led workers, and the strike is finally nullified when Thornton brings in 
replacements from Ireland who are willing to work at any wage.

Thornton had been taking lessons from Margaret’s father, but he ultimately gets 
his tutoring in the humanities when he begins to form relationships with some of 
his workers after seeing the misery of their conditions during the strike, even 
as his business spirals downward due to the interruption in production and his 
debts being called in.

Margaret lies to the authorities about her involvement in Frederick’s scuffle 
and escape in order to protect her brother, and Thornton finds out about her 
lies. Her repulsion toward Thornton is exacerbated by her Christian remorse and 
guilt over her lies and what she imagines Thornton must think of her. Late in 
the novel she undergoes a long period of introspection and self-recrimination. 
During a visit to her tiny home town which in her childhood had seemed ageless, 
she is dispirited to see visible changes in just the few years since she has 
left. She muses:

>I begin to understand now what heaven must be - and, oh ! the grandeur and 
repose of the words - “The same yesterday, today, and for ever.” Everlasting! 
“From everlasting to everlasting, Thou art God.” That sky above me looks as 
though it could not change, and yet it will. I am so tired - so tired of being 
whirled on through all these phases of my life, in which nothing abides by me, 
no creature, no place; it is like the circle in which the victims of earthly 
passion eddy continually.

This passage, as the core expression of Margaret’s crisis, surprised me because 
of its modernity. It is exactly like the crisis pronounced in the play *Angels 
in America*, in which the angel Metatron demands that humanity “Stop moving!” 
This demand and this nostalgia are the end result of the neurotic Christian 
yearning for sinlessness as the only conceivable embodiment of personal 
integrity. For finally the only possible sinless world in the Christian 
worldview is a static one.

Thus the crux of the anxiety about industrialization is not due ultimately to 
its social or political ramifications. On the deepest level it represents (to 
what Orwell called ‘oldbelievers’) a storming of Heaven. Manchester in the novel 
goes by the pseudonym ‘Milton’, which I dare say is a reference to the poem by 
William Blake; which contains the lines:

\medskip
<i>

|       And did the Countenance Divine,
|      Shine forth upon our clouded hills?
|      And was Jerusalem builded here,
|      Among these dark Satanic Mills?

</i>
\medskip

Meanwhile Thornton is undergoing a crisis of his own, though a more positive 
one.  He has gone bankrupt, but he is energetically trying to raise backers to 
restart his business with a new management approach, inspired by the empathy he 
learned from his workers in the last days of his previous enterprise:

>I felt that I was on the right path, and that, starting from a kind of 
friendship with one, I was becoming acquainted with many. The advantages were 
mutual: we were both unconsciously and consciously teaching each other…

>My only wish is to have the opportunity of cultivating some intercourse with 
the hands beyond the mere ''cash nexus”...

>I have arrived at the conviction that no mere institutions, however wise, and 
however much thought may have been required to organize and arrange them, can 
attach class to class as they should be attached, unless the working out of such 
institutions bring the individuals of the different classes into actual personal 
contact. Such intercourse is the very breath of life. A working man can hardly 
be made to feel and know how much his employer may have laboured in his study at 
plans for the benefit of his workpeople. A complete plan emerges like a piece of 
machinery, apparently fitted for every emergency. But the hands accept it as 
they do machinery, without understanding the intense mental labour and 
forethought required to bring it to such perfection. But I would take an idea, 
the working out of which would necessitate personal intercourse; it might not go 
well at first, but at every hitch interest would be felt by an increasing number 
of men, and at last its success in working come to be desired by all, as all had 
borne a part in the formation of the plan; and even then I am sure that it would 
lose its vitality, cease to be living, as soon as it was no longer carried on by 
that sort of common interest which invariably makes people find means and ways 
of seeing each other, and becoming acquainted with each other's characters and 
persons, and even tricks of tempers and modes of speech. We should understand 
each other better, and I'll venture to say we should like each other more.

The term “cash nexus” above is a contemporary one used in critiques of 
capitalism at the time. It was used in relation to the observation that 
capitalism tended to drive out of the public forum any notion that humans had 
any obligations or social commitments whatsoever to one another, beyond mere 
cash transactions.[^char]

As Thornton is having these epiphanies in the novel’s last pages, the tables 
have turned. Margaret has inherited significant wealth, yet she can escape 
neither the guilt and remorse of the lies she told about her brother (even 
though it was to save his live) nor the feeling that she is living under the 
silent opprobrium of Thornton and his family (despite the fact that Thornton, 
after his declaration of love was rebuffed, has resolved never to acknowledge 
any of his feelings toward her and limits himself to strictly correct social 
pleasantries).

Despite these complexities of plot and character, it turns out that everything 
works itself out literally in the last two pages. Margaret offers a loan to 
Thornton to help him restart his business… Thornton simply replies 
“Margaret!”... and after a few halting sentences and long silences, they fall 
into each other’s arms and all is resolved between and within them.

But these two pages are enough for the trap Gaskell has set to be sprung, and 
for the key to be discovered. In the months preceding this scene, Margaret's 
ordeal of introspection and soul-searching made her more humble, more 
empathetic, more calm. It seemed like a sort of personal growth fitting for the 
wrap-up of a long novel. In fact something had gone terribly wrong; for in 
trying to resolve her feelings about Thornton she makes a conciliatory gesture 
in the form of a business transaction: “if you would take some money of mine, 
eighteen thousand and fifty-seven pounds, lying just at this moment unused in 
the bank, and bringing me in only two and a half per cent. – you could pay me 
much better interest, and might go on working Marlborough Mills.” Somewhere 
along the line her self-perceived sin became an unbearable burden, and to 
anaesthetize her feelings she let herself fall into the worldview of the 
cash nexus.

On some level, Thornton recognizes the poison of her offer and evades its 
danger. Instead, he takes to heart his own preaching about new ways to manage 
relationships, drops his pride and wounded feelings, and insists on a moment of 
purely human interaction between them, much of which necessarily (but a bit 
surprisingly for a novelist) takes place in silence.

And this is enough for the breakthrough. Gaskell has resolved to show that 
neither Christian piety nor libertarian dynamism is sufficient to address the 
issues of her present moment in history. She repudiates both her own religious 
background and her adopted hometown’s guiding animus to insist on something 
more.

Speaking of *Angels in America*, I want to think the two works inform each other 
and help illuminate their endings. In the play, God has absconded from Heaven, 
causing consternation and panic among the angels. They want to entice Him back 
by removing the blot of sin from His creation, but they believe they can only do 
this by putting humanity into stasis. Humanity politely refuses this solution.

Gaskell’s polite refusal of the options presented to her by her cultural milieu 
reflects Prior Walter’s. And among the bereft and the lonely, the only remaining 
vision of how to bring God back is to call Him forth within the matrix of human 
relationships, in the form of the Shekinah – to regenerate Him as it were, in 
the milieu of a brave new Creation.

The Great Work begins…


[^char]: “Cash Payment had not then grown to be the universal sole nexus of man 
to man; it was something other than money that the high then expected from the 
low, and could not live without getting from the low. Not as buyer and seller 
alone, of land or what else it might be, but in many senses still as soldier and 
captain, as clansman and head, as loyal subject and guiding king, was the low 
related to the high. With the supreme triumph of Cash, a changed time has 
entered.” –Thomas Carlyle, *Chartism*, 1839
