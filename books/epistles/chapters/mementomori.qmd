# Memento Mori

#### Muriel Spark {.unlisted}

*Book Club July 9, 2023*

---

The Scottish novelist Muriel Spark converted to Catholicism as an adult and 
credited her new religion with enabling her to become a successful writer. But 
in *Memento Mori,* she shows no evidence of interest in such things as grace or 
redemption for her characters.  The novel’s main characters are senior citizens, 
most of them dealing with their last days of physical and mental soundness; yet 
Spark seems to write gleefully of them as ninnies and neurotics – wasting their 
time running about trying to get the most of the time they have left when they 
could be doing the decent thing and simply disappearing from public life into 
the variety of care homes and hospices waiting for them.

The only character she shows evident sympathy for is the wickedest of them, the 
bully and crook in her early senior phase who does her best to corral and 
exploit the other elders in her grasp.  Spark here reminds me of what Blake said 
of John Milton, the intensely religious author of *Paradise Lost* and *Paradise 
Regained*: “The reason Milton wrote in fetters when he wrote of Angels & God and 
at liberty when of Devils & Hell is because he was… of the Devil's party without 
knowing it.”[^mil]

The main characters are being harassed by an anonymous serial phone caller, who 
simply says “Remember you must die” to his targets. That and the title suggest 
that the theme of the novel is that life needs to be put into perspective by 
keeping awareness of death’s inevitability close.  There are also suggestions 
that there is honor in memorializing the dead: Alec Warner and Jean Taylor,
former lovers, muse about the ephemerality of existence:

|       "Do you think, Jean, that other people exist?... you see that here is a 
|      respectable question. Given that you believe in your own existence as 
|      self-evident, do you believe in that of others? Tell me, Jean, do 
|      you believe that I for instance, at this moment, exist?"
|       “...One does sometimes wonder, perhaps only half-consciously, if 
|      other people are real.”
|       "Please," he said, "wonder more than half-consciously about this question. 
|      Wonder about it with as much consciousness as you have, and tell me what 
|      is your answer."
|       "Oh," she said, "I think in that case, other people do exist. That's my 
|      answer. It's only common sense… This graveyard is a kind of evidence," she 
|      said, "that other people exist."
|       "...They are, I quite see, they are," he said, "an indication of the
|      existence of others, for there are the names and times carved in stone.    
|      Not a proof, but at least a large testimony."
|       "...But the graves are at least reassuring," she said, "for why bother to 
|      bury people if they don't exist?"

Their conversation suggests a literary project of anchoring the existence of us 
the living, in this modern age, via acknowledgement of the dead and those near 
death; the novel thus becoming something of an embodiment of the title, a 
first draft of a eulogy. But later the narrative turns to suggest that 
acknowledging death means the undoing of life and certainty, rather than the 
culmination and crowning of them. Later, after Jean has retired to a nursing 
home, she says to Alec:

> We all appear to ourselves frustrated in our old age, Alec, because we cling 
to everything so much. But in reality we are still [in retirement] fulfilling 
our lives.

But in her case as in most of the others, the fulfillment seems to come from 
giving up, from letting go of one’s life’s goals and giving in to the 
uncertainties of meaning and existence, embodied in the uncertainty about the 
nature of the phone stalker. Sparks’ sympathies go to the characters who retire 
and disappear, and directs mockery to those who continue to try living a full 
life.

The exception, and the turn of narrative purpose, comes in depiction of the 
antics of Mrs. Pettigrew, the live-in caretaker who browbeats her elderly 
charges into docility for her own convenience, engages in power struggles 
against other servants who might challenge her will, and snoops her way into 
blackmail opportunities.  Her verve, energy and clarity of purpose distinguish 
her from the other characters, and she is the only one fruitfully in command of 
her life’s direction.

The unveiling of Sparks’ true attitude and agenda in her delight with Mrs. 
Pettigrew suggests another commentary on Milton: “was Milton trying to tell us 
that being bad was more fun than being good?”[^anmlhse]
