# At The Mountains Of Madness

#### H.P. Lovecraft {.unlisted}

*Book Club October 22, 2023*

---

A lot of science fiction concerns itself with the question ‘what will encounter 
with the unknown be like?’ Sometimes, as in the first science fiction novel,
*Frankenstein* the imagined answer is horror in the face of what lies beyond
death. In Lovecraft’s short novel *At The Mountains Of Madness*, encounter with
the unknown is set in the then-unexplored interior of Antarctica. The story
takes the form of a manuscript whose writer, a scientist himself, is attempting
to warn the world that his expedition has discovered an ancient and malevolent
evil lurking beneath the polar ice. He is adamant that his fellow scientists
dare not risk disturbing that evil with further exploration, at the risk of all
human civilization.

But it's important here to start with the understanding that the look and feel
of the unknown is not really a mystery. For example: the Spanish conquistadors’ 
first sighting of the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan in 1519 -- the city was built 
by an alien civilization, ten times larger than any city in Europe, with 
temples larger than any cathedral, and streets filled with tropical flowers and 
brightly-costumed people. A soldier, Bernal Diaz del Castillo, wrote of the 
experience years later:


>we could compare it to nothing but the enchanted scenes we had read of in 
Amadis of Gaul,[^ama] from the great towers and temples and other edifices of 
lime and stone which seemed to rise out of the water. To many of us it appeared 
doubtful whether we were asleep or awake; nor is the manner in which I express 
myself to be wondered at, for it must be considered, that never yet did man 
see, hear, or dream of any thing equal to the spectacle which appeared to our 
eyes on this day.


In the face of the total unknown, space and time collapse, dream, fantasy and 
reality intermingle, and consciousness becomes a mirror. It is in the blind spot 
hidden by reflection where mythmaking begins; where landscapes are embroidered 
from threads of self and memory.

Just as was depicted in *Frankenstein*: when Victor first sees his creature 
stir with life, he does not react with elation, or joy, or triumph or 
vindication. Strangely, he flees his laboratory, goes to bed, and dreams of his 
fiancee and dead mother fusing into one.

Or as Nietzsche said, simply, "gaze not into the abyss, lest the abyss gaze 
back into you."[^nie]

The novel’s title itself comes from a story by Lord Dunsany,[^dun] denoting a 
liminal barrier to a world of drugged dreams.

The objective of mythmaking is to obscure the abyss, to safeguard consciousness 
from the terror of it.  It is left to literature to uncover the mirror, if the 
threads can be untangled, and acknowledge the reflection.

When the novel was published, Antarctica was one of the last frontiers of the 
unknown on planet Earth. As the expedition ship of the narrator, geologist 
William Dyer, approaches the coast, he sees several examples of what today are 
called *fata morgana*, weird mirages (like ships hovering in air over the 
water) caused by the extreme atmospheric conditions of the polar region: "On 
many occasions the curious atmospheric effects enchanted me vastly; these 
including a strikingly vivid mirage... in which distant bergs became the 
battlements of unimaginable cosmic castles."

After the expedition makes landfall and subsequent events make necessary a 
rescue mission by airplane into the continental interior, it is a particularly 
vivid mirage seen from the air that Lovecraft portrays as a portal into the 
unknown. Dyer states:


>I had seen dozens of polar mirages during the preceding weeks, some of them 
quite as uncanny and fantastically vivid as the present sample; but this one 
had a wholly novel and obscure quality of menacing symbolism, and I shuddered 
as the seething labyrinth of fabulous walls and towers and minarets loomed out 
of the troubled ice-vapours above our heads.

>The effect was that of a Cyclopean city of no architecture known to man or to 
human imagination, with vast aggregations of night-black masonry embodying 
monstrous perversions of geometrical laws and attaining the most grotesque 
extremes of sinister bizarrerie... the implied scale of the whole was 
terrifying and oppressive in its sheer giganticism.


The mirage turns out to be an uncanny vision of collapsed space and time. 
Unknown to Dyer at the time of sighting, the mirage was an accurate portrayal 
of a vastly ancient city in its prime millions of years ago, whose ruins lay 
far away from his  location, to be discovered later by him and his companion.

His passage into the void had a visceral effect on him, marking what he 
recognized as a caesura in his experience:


>Every incident of that four-and-a-half-hour flight is burned into my 
recollection because of its crucial position in my life. It marked my loss, at 
the age of fifty-four, of all that peace and balance which the normal mind 
possesses through its accustomed conception of external Nature and Nature’s 
laws. Thenceforward the ten of us -- but the student Danforth and myself above 
all others -- were to face a hideously amplified world of lurking horrors which 
nothing can erase from our emotions, and which we would refrain from sharing 
with mankind in general if we could.


Dyer and Danforth try to come to the rescue of an exploratory party that had 
awakened a group of weird aliens from hibernation, and track the aliens into 
the ruins of the city. Dyer claims that while there he learned the story of 
the aliens and their city by examining plentiful bas-relief murals carved by 
former generations of aliens, still visible on the walls of ruined buildings.

As he and Danforth penetrate deeper into the city in search of survivors, 
Dyer’s feelings of revulsion, obscenity and antipathy increase, but he is 
driven on by scientific curiosity as well as the urgency of rescue. But he 
unexpectedly reaches a critical point of information about the aliens, whereby 
his horror is somewhat replaced by a sudden empathy. The aliens he was tracking 
had gone into suspended animation thirty million years ago for unknown reasons, 
when Antarctica was a lush tropical paradise and their civilization was at its 
peak. They were awakened by human explorers into a harsh and brutal snowscape, 
their city and civilization in ruins, and an even greater horror awaiting them 
below it:


>After all, they were not evil things of their kind. They were the men of 
another age and another order of being. Nature had played a hellish jest on 
them... and this was their tragic homecoming.

>They had not been even savages -- for what indeed had they done? That awful 
awakening in the cold of an unknown epoch... poor Old Ones! Scientists to the 
last -- what had they done that we would not have done in their place? God, 
what intelligence and persistence! What a facing of the incredible, just as 
those carven kinsmen and forbears had faced things only a little less 
incredible! Radiates, vegetables, monstrosities, star-spawn -- whatever they 
had been, they were men!

>They had crossed the icy peaks on whose templed slopes they had once 
worshipped and roamed among the tree-ferns. They had found their dead city 
brooding under its curse, and had read its carven latter days as we had done. 
They had tried to reach their living fellows in fabled depths of blackness they 
had never seen -- and what had they found?


Why did these aliens subject themselves to a sleep of millions of years, to 
find they had outlasted their own kind?  There is no answer within the 
narrative. There are only hints, contained within the story presented in the 
city’s many mural carvings:


>according to certain carvings the denizens of that city had themselves known 
the clutch of oppressive terror; for there was a sombre and recurrent type of 
scene in which the Old Ones were shewn in the act of recoiling affrightedly 
from some object -- never allowed to appear in the design -- found in the great 
river and indicated as having been washed down through waving, vine-draped 
cycad-forests from those horrible westward mountains.


This is a remarkable passage.  It creates a parallelism of thematic structure. 
Just as the human explorers faced the boundary of the unknown and penetrated 
into a mythical landscape beyond it, so the aliens within that landscape faced 
a boundary of their own. The problem of what the unknown looks like is not 
solved, because the problem recurses, to a more deeply embedded bourn before 
another unglimpsed mystery. Thus the limitation of mythmaking is revealed, and 
by stacking of metaphor becomes literature. The reader is again left before a 
mirror.

And so the mythical question of origin is replaced by the literary question, 
handed down in a direct line from the fount of science fiction: what does the 
mirror reveal?

Dyer’s sudden burst of empathy for the aliens, the "Elder Things", shows that 
there is an alternate interpretation of their story, and calls into question 
his initial reactions of repugnance and condemnation. So I will attempt another 
reading of the facts of their eons-long history on Earth as they are presented, 
a theory of their motivations hinted at by the stark flare lights of irony on 
the Antarctic plain:

<i>
\itshape

The Elder Things are space spores, floating or flying through space without 
ships, exposed bodily to the void. They are intellectually advanced and have 
built civilizations. And they are aware of the many dangers and threats that 
exist in the universe, and flee from them when necessary. Some of them make 
their way to earth as spores do, perhaps inevitably, and settle here, over 
three billion years in the past.

At this point in Earth's development, the Archaean era, it is a lifeless ocean 
planet; sunny, silent, sterile. But the Elder Things’ adaptable physiology 
allows them to absorb the ocean’s rich nutrients directly. They find Earth ideal 
for their needs, they can hide from their enemies at the bottom of the sea and 
simply be, in a paradise of mere existence. And there they stay for a half 
billion years or more.

They come to love Earth and think of it as home as much as an alien race can. 
They understand that they are vagabonds of the universe, and are grateful for 
their refuge. But they also come to understand the creative potential of the 
nutrient-rich oceans under the warm sun, and can’t deny it or retard it 
forever. So they create life, or allow it to germinate, and guide and nurture 
its development.

They eschew the technological forms of civilization that their ancestors had 
mastered elsewhere, and choose in this place the opportunity to live in harmony 
with nature as it develops.

Where previously they would flee from danger, here they fight costly wars to 
defend their home against invaders. Eventually they evolve to lose the capacity 
for space travel altogether, and become as close to true Earthlings as they can.

They also become city builders, leaving behind their serene benthic rurality to 
further their global project of fostering the development of life. Rather than 
employ industrial technology, they create shoggoths, protoplasmic life forms 
that assume shapes and sizes necessary for large scale construction.

But their lives are so long, and their civilization has such continuity, that 
they witness a succession of their greatest urban projects consumed by tectonic 
plate action as continents are born and die over eons. They realize that in 
their perception of time, life is the only legacy of theirs that has a chance 
of lasting.

And so their ambition for their project grows. The shoggoths, formerly 
automatons, had developed a form of restive consciousness. This inspires the 
Elder Things to breed intelligent life, proper heirs, with the awareness to 
recognize and show gratitude to their creators, as the Elder Things were 
grateful for their Earth home.

As the first apes appear in Africa and Asia, at last a species with rudimentary 
awareness, the Elder Things resolve to create one last great city in 
Antarctica; to carry out their project, and to make an exhaustive record of 
their time on the planet for when the descendents of the apes can understand it. 
They capture some ape specimens and implant into them the genetic potential for 
consciousness, as well as the brain mechanism for a visual trigger that will 
activate when an ape descendent views the basilisk-like geometric patterns the 
Elder Things have placed next to the carved illustrative tableaux on their 
building walls. The trigger will initiate complete coded transmission of the 
Elder Things’ story straight into the conscious mind, so it will be known even 
if the Elders themselves no longer exist by the time the tableaux are found.

In order to be able to welcome their heirs even if the Elder civilization is 
wiped out, fifteen Elder Things agree to seal themselves in an underground cave 
in suspended animation, as a living time capsule. They stock the cave with 
fossil records of every era of life, as a sort of museum to demonstrate the 
continuity and consistency of effort that led to the ultimate arising of the 
heir species. Once the cavern is sealed, onee Elder applies to the other 
fourteen their race’s ancient technology invented to allow survival during 
their spore-distribution in space, adapted to allow an indefinite sleep in the 
cave. The one Elder survives the long treatment process by consuming animals 
stocked in the cave for provisions. Once the job is done on the fourteen, the 
one artisan maintains the seal on the cavern and accepts death by starvation.

On the surface, the shoggoths participate in the city building and the 
fostering of conscious life, but eventually they realize the full scope of the 
project. They are being replaced, by a fully welcomed and valued conscious 
culmination of the Elder Things entire sojourn on earth. However problematic the 
history between Elder and shoggoth had been, they had a shared history and a 
shared home. Now the Elders were making them redundant, treating them merely as 
a means to an end.

Where the shoggoths had previously rebelled for freedom, now they did so for 
revenge, and all the more violently.  As they murder their creators, they 
scream in mockery a phrase that the Elders had intended to use to welcome their 
creation when the new species was mature enough to come exploring. They write 
the phrase in Elder blood on the walls of the city as an execration and an 
anathema.

With the Elder civilization destroyed, the shoggoths emulate their creators in 
their earliest innocent phase of millions of years at the bottom of the sea, 
and retreat into the vast subterranean body of water below the city, to sulk 
and try to forget their insults and indignities.

When the new species finally arrived, they were in a degenerate state, the 
Elders not having been able to guide them to their final intended form after 
the shoggoth revolt. The first meeting of humans with the cavern Elders 
awakened from suspended animation resulted in fatal confusion and
misunderstanding. The encodings in the walls meant to activate information 
transfer to the human brain worked only partially, and transmitted a message of 
horror rather than enlightenment. Worse, left as orphans for ages, humans had 
fallen out of communion with the order of nature, and had developed a 
technological, objectifying, alienating scientific mindset. This mindset led 
the humans to interpret the idea that they were part of a continuity, with a 
past, with creators who had intended to make them heirs -- rather than 
self-made and supreme to nature -- as so repugnant it had to be expelled from 
consciousness.

The novel incorporates some of Lovecraft’s oeuvre-wide mythos, but stands 
independent of it, and shows awareness of the mythmaking as an incomplete and 
abortive obsession. The novel completes a tragic story of its own, beyond myth, 
illuminated by irony. That is to say, there is no point devising a literary 
mirror without the possibility of showing the reflection. Parallel thematic 
structures point the way to how the irony incorporates and implicates the 
reader, and perhaps even the author:

The tragedy revealed is that we are exiles, castaways in time, which is too 
vast for us ever to get the advantage of -- eventually it will do worse than 
kill us, it will dispossess us and make us vagabonds, no matter our 
pretensions.[^diaz] The power of life can encircle the void of meaninglessness, 
but never extinguish it. The only option is -- like Sisyphus -- to embrace the 
futility rather than contend against it, and keep pushing on. The only Hell is 
to try to push alone, or to exclude some in the common effort. Yet our 
objectifying, stratifying scientific mindset prevents us from seeing this.

Through the novel runs the thread of mystery of what exactly Dyer’s young 
companion Danforth saw in the mirage they encountered on the plane trip back 
from the cursed city, a sight that finally unglued him and immersed him in 
unremitting horror. But what he must have seen is clear. Just as happened on the 
plane trip in, space and time collapsed within the mirage, and he saw a 
reflection of himself, superimposed on a vision of an Elder Thing in its prime 
of thirty million years ago, and saw the family resemblance. The Elder spoke to 
him across the ages, and at last Danforth understood the meaning and 
implications of the phrase in the Elder language that the human exploring party 
had heard echoing in the halls of the city's ruins, the phrase the shoggoths 
had screamed mockingly at the Elders as they did their murder...

*"My Children!"*





[^ama]: A collection of medieval romantic fantasy stories.

[^nie]: This is the quote as I first encountered and remembered it. But I found 
it has a curious literary history. In the original German, it was phrased more 
as an observation; first translated into English as: "if thou gaze long into an 
abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee." It was successively misquoted over 
the past century or more, and underwent a pop-cultural transformation; from 
observation to warning, from a description of the confoundment I'm talking 
about to an example of it.

[^dun]: Dunsany was perhaps the first writer of completely invented fantasy, 
unconnected to any existing mythology or body of legend, woven completely out 
of his inner being. Lovecraft was of course a fan.

[^diaz]: When Diaz was writing of his experiences in Tenochtitlan, the city was 
already gone: "I beheld the scenes that were around me, I thought within myself 
that this was the garden of the world! ... but all is destroyed, and that which 
was a lake is now a tract of fields of Indian corn, and so entirely altered that 
the natives themselves could hardly know it."
