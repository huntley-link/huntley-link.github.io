# Myra Breckinridge

#### Gore Vidal {.unlisted}

*Book Club July 30, 2023*

---

Myra Breckinridge is a modern warrior woman who has set herself on a quest for 
total fulfillment of all fantasies; chief of these being the total obliteration 
of traditional masculinity, thus turning humanity androgynous and averting the 
prospect of nuclear armageddon. She is subject and object of her heroic story, 
trying to save the world by saving herself.

The novel is the most unexpected and idiosyncratic of Gore Vidal's novels. It 
is both an exemplary product of the late 1960's and a cauldron of of the themes 
and obsessions that had filled his work from the beginning of his career.

In its anarchism, it undercuts and flips the table on every assertion, every 
expectation of the reader and every narrative breadcrumb trail laid down -- to 
the extent that it's difficult to envision how even to start talking about it, 
or how to end.  Narrative summary? Themes? Character development? Social and 
political commentary? Ultimate meaning? The novel works to frustrate 
analysis or engagement from any angle.

It is a work of high literature that has the internal logic and structure of a 
cheap porn novel.  Parts of the narrative are as contrived as the poolman 
arriving to find a young woman home alone in a skimpy bikini. I think that is 
because whenever a work undertakes to undermine and delegitimize all social 
conventions and mannerisms, even those of the rebels, nonconformists and 
freaks, choices of formal structure become limited -- shortcuts have to be 
taken to get to the good parts.  Be it a product of high or low culture the end 
result is often a horseshoe effect:  a meeting in the middle, and the vulgar 
and refined wits become both targets and echoes of each other. For example when 
a narrative work busies itself with capturing total anarchy in the face of 
impending obliteration, it often turns out that there are only two acceptable 
choices for wrapping things up: breaking the frame (as in *Naked Lunch*, *Monty 
Python and the Holy Grail*, *The Final Programme*, *The Bacchae*, *Blazing 
Saddles*), or a contrapuntal reversion to conservative domesticity (*A 
Clockwork Orange*, *Natural Born Killers*, *Deep Throat*, Robert Heinlein's 
*Job*, *Candide*).  As it turns out, *Myra Breckinridge* opts for the latter. 
The author consequently risks disappointment or fury on the part of the 
reader... but really, what other choices were there?

It's tempting to approach *Myra* as a work of self-examination and 
self-criticism on Vidal's part.  But I don't think it should be necessary to 
reference the life of the artist to comprehend the artwork. On the other hand, 
with this work who knows what goes.  Maybe Vidal simply considered himself one 
of the overblown contemporary mainstream idols to be knocked over.

Early along, Myra is clearly Vidal’s voice. In her erudition and love of films, 
particularly her adoration of film critic Parker Tyler, she echoes him. Her 
thoughts run to the sublime: "Tyler's vision (films are the unconscious 
expressions of age-old human myths) is perhaps the only important critical 
insight this century has produced... Auden once wrote an entire poem praising 
limestone, unaware that any one of a thousand frames from *Tarzan and the 
Amazons* (1945) had not only anticipated him but made irrelevant his efforts."

Later she embodies Vidal's worldly cynicism: "what, finally, are human 
relations but the desire in each of us to exercise absolute power over others?"

And: "It is hate alone which inspires us to action and makes for civilization. 
Look at Juvenal, Pope, Billy Wilder."

As the story progresses, she becomes tedious -- in conversation with the young 
people she condescends to as if children, she starts to sound like the most 
annoying person in a college dorm lounge:

> I was brilliant. I quoted the best of the world’s food authorities (famine 
for us all by 1974 and forget about plankton and seaweed: not enough of it). I 
demonstrated that essentially Malthus had been right, despite errors of 
calculation... What is to be done? How is the race to be saved...? My answer 
was simple enough: famine and war are now man’s only hope. To survive, human 
population must be drastically reduced. Happily, our leaders are working 
instinctively toward that end, and there is no doubt in my mind that nature 
intends Lyndon Johnson and Mao Tse-tung to be the agents of our salvation... If 
I say so myself, I had my listeners’ eyes bugging out by the time I had 
sketched for them man’s marvelous if fiery fate.

Vidal taking himself down a peg here? Self-satire? Acknowledging how tiresome 
his parlor-room polemics could be?

But as Myra's thoughts and discourse become more convoluted and profane, she is 
falling in love with Mary-Ann, a beautiful young woman, and losing sight of 
her objective of destroying masculinity. Mary-Ann's love draws Myra away from 
fantasies of disintegration and brings her back around to visions of wholeness, 
here:

> Though I yearn romantically for the classic films of the Forties, I know 
that they can never be reproduced since their era is as gone as the Depression, 
World War II and the national innocence which made it possible for Pandro S. 
Berman and a host of others to decorate the screens of tens of thousands of 
movie theatres with perfect dreams. There was a wholeness then which is lacking 
now

and here:

> there is something about Mary-Ann’s wholeness that excites me. There is a 
mystery to be plumbed, though whether or not it is in her or in myself or in us 
both I do not know.

Yet just as Myra and Mary-Ann's love is about to reach a place of perfected 
satisfaction, wholeness proves to be a chimera. Myra is involved in a car 
accident; she is surgically undone and remade and learns to live with a new 
identity, her quest for rapture left behind.  In its place is a new lifestyle 
in a different mode of incompleteness. But that is not a barrier to happiness; 
rather, in a broken world one may find that in one's brokenness one is, as Sam 
Spade observed "in step with life."

Is this the message and meaning of the novel?  If so is it uplifting or 
a cop-out? If Myra is Vidal's voice does the ending represent a life lesson 
accepted by Vidal himself?

Vidal was not one for embracing domesticity. Or rather, he oscillated 
for decades between a mutant form of domesticity in Italy, and part-time 
residence ensconced in the apocalyptic vistas of California amid the illusion 
and self-deception he despised. Does the record of his own restless and surreal 
life invalidate the apparent conclusion of the novel? Can any author be held so 
personally responsible for the integrity of one's work?

I got a strange glimmer of insight from an unexpected source.  The novel *A 
Clockwork Orange* by Anthony Burgess is kin to *Myra* in its anarchic and 
apocalyptic vision. It also features an unexpected reversion to domesticity, 
infuriating to some readers. In its final chapter (cut from the film) the main 
character Alex decides to give up his life of gang violence, sex crimes, drugs 
and alcohol. He resolves instead to settle down, look for love, maybe even 
start a family. While imagining the eagerness with which he will be replaced in 
his gang hierarchy, he muses, "Power power, everybody like wants power."

Alex's observation mirrors those of Myra/Vidal. But even as Alex expresses it 
he is already transitioning away from this mindset and resolving to find 
something more in human relationships. Does the fact that Alex is making this 
statement at this time indicate not that he believes it, but is objectifying 
and othering the concept, thus suggesting that he is moving beyond it?

This contradiction in a spiritually related novel made me wonder if a similar 
dynamic was at work in Vidal, not so far-fetched a concept I think in a genre 
where denial is plenary and choices of formal approach are constrained.  Was 
his well-practiced patter of cynical public statements concerning power, greed, 
empire, love, etc. not a rubric of his viewpoints (as he let his audiences 
assume), but an exercise in keeping himself from being entrapped by them, of 
defeating their neurotic power and maintaining his distance from them?

Either this, or *Myra Breckinridge* is a work of slippery cynicism, in which 
Vidal fits himself for a straitjacket and then wriggles out of it and 
disappears leaving the reader to wonder what happened.

Or perhaps what Vidal reveals is that he both believed his cynical assertions 
and didn't believe them, just as he was a domesticated resident of Italy and 
also a participant in the dreamworld of his second home Los Angeles, as he was 
a man who said he didn't understand love and was the creator of Myra whose life 
climaxed in eloquent praise of love's glory and mystery.

The only way I could satisfy myself with reading this novel was to envision 
Vidal as a sort of modern Dionysian priest, empowered by his visionary 
authorial rituals to move between modes, to partake periodically in the madness 
of the gods yet not be ripped apart, given the divine grace to retreat into 
safe domesticity when the revels were ended. As such he acted as envoy and 
intermediary between worlds: able to receive visions and hear voices and 
then bring them back to his audience’s ken, untouched, but empty.
